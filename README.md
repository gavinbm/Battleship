# Battleship!

Simple battleship game that you can play in your terminal. Plan to make this a CLI tool so you can play
it from any directory on your system but that's a problem I'll solve after finals.

# Installation
1) clone the repo
2) enter the repo directory
3) enter the command: make
4) enter the command: ./battleship X Y

X and Y in step 4 determine the size of your board. X is the number of columns, Y is the number of rows.

Have fun :D
